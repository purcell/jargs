Prerequisites
-------------

For each prerequisite, the version with which JArgs has been tested is given 
in parentheses.  Any version equal to or later than this should work.

To build JArgs and run its tests you need on of 

- [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) (1.8.2), by The Apache Software
  Foundation
- [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) (3.0.4), by The Apache Software
  Foundation

Moreover [JUnit](http://www.junit.org/) (4.3.1), by Eric Gamma, is used to run
the unit tests, but is not needed to run the library itself.


Installation
------------

To compile, package, and test the code, run either

    ant

or

    mvn clean package javadoc:javadoc jar:test-jar

Two jars are created, one called `target/jargs-$VERSION$.jar`, which contains
the runtime library, and one called `target/jargs-$VERSION$-tests.jar`, which
contains the unit tests and the examples.  The Javadoc APIs are created in
`target/site/apidocs`.

To use the library with your own code, simply ensure that
`target/jargs-$VERSION$.jar` is on the CLASSPATH.


Documentation
-------------

The main documentation is the detailed worked example in
`src/test/resources/com/sanityinc/jargs/examples/gnu/OptionTest.java`, plus the
generated API documentation in `target/site/apidocs`.
