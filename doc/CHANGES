Changes from 0.5 to 1.0
=======================

- Added getOptionValue(Option, Object) which takes an Object as a potential
  default value for the given Option.  If the option is not present on the
  command line, the default is returned instead.  This addresses bug 1051346
  submitted by Tomas Znamenacek, and feature request 527808.

- Added getOptionValues(Option) which will return a list of occurrences of a
  single option, and added the ability internally to cope with such multiple
  occurrences.  This accepts and uses patch 1164413, and closes patch 1083615
  (it solves the same problem in a better way).

- Added support for concatenated boolean options (those written -bcd where -b,
  -c, and -d are boolean options).  This accepts and uses patch 621087 by
  Vidar Holen.

- Added some more unit tests.

- Some code clean-ups.

Changes from 0.4 to 0.5
=======================

- Allow Options that have a long form only

- Added LongOption

- Corrected some typos in example code (thanks Chris McKay)

- More tests

Changes from 0.3 to 0.4
=======================

- Switched from makefiles to Ant

- Some code clean-ups

- Support locale-dependent parsing of Double options

Changes from 0.2 to 0.3
=======================

- Added 'DoubleOption' class, and 'addDoubleOption()' convenience method
  (suggested independently by Nick Roy and Karl Koster)

- Made 'Option.getValue()' and 'Option.parseValue()' take a Locale, so
  that parsing of values can be locale-dependent. (Locale-specific parsing
  is not however implemented for DoubleOption and IntegerOption.)

- Constructor of 'IllegalOptionValueException' is now public so that it can
  be thrown by the 'parseValue()' methods of custom Option subclasses

- 'CmdLineParser.addOption()' now returns the passed in Option, which
  can make client code less clunky.

- Added 'DoubleOption' to example classes

- Added a 'CustomOptionTest' class to demonstrate subclassing of Option
  via the implementation of a ShortDateOption class.

- Added this CHANGES file.

- Added overridden CmdLineParser.parse() which takes a Locale instance,
  and made both versions of the method final.
